As a commuting student, I find that I have large amounts of time on my hands where I’m in the car, or I’m walking across campus, or I’m at work. I am a part time content screener, which means I do a lot of tasks for a website that really require little focus and more tasks for the website that take hours to do. As a result, I started listening to a lot of podcasts. As with most podcast listeners, I started listening to podcasts when Serial (from WNYC) first came out, and since then have expanded my podcast listening. While Serial still remains a favorite, I realize that there are other shows I listen to that are just as good. Here are my favorites:

I started listening to this podcast about a year ago, and obsessively listening to every single episode in about a month. This show is a product of Gimlet Media, a company I am very fond of, and it is a podcast about the internet.  Because technology plays such a large part in culture and everyday life, this podcast discusses and describes weird things happening on the internet or simply how the internet has affected some weird aspect of life. The hosts, P.J. and Alex, are a match made in heaven, who really know a lot about the internet. My favorite segment, Yes Yes No, includes P.J. and Alex ridiculing their boss about his lack of knowledge about the internet, which strangely reminds me of the conversations my dad and I have. Episodes to listen to would The Cathedral, Blind Spot, and Long Distance. 
  
 In the Dark
 
From APM reporting, In The Dark is a true crime podcast that is seriously addicting and deserves more credit. The first season covers the Jacob Wetterling investigation in Minnesota and season two covers the Curtis Flowers trial in Mississippi. This is a podcast that you can easily binge on and deserves a chance. 

Armchair Expert

Dax Shepard is the host of this hilariously awesome podcast and he will definitely keep you entertained. Dax is charming and willing to ask questions that are deep and meaningful. Although, I do have to admit that Monica piping in every once in a while is what I look forward to in each episode. Dax interviews a variety of people and is able to showcase celebrities and authors in a light that is endearing and authentic. Give it a listen!
