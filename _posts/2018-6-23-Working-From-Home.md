I have worked from home for about four years. Two were for a call center and the other two were for a website proofing content. Just to be upfront about this, I don’t think that working from home is for everyone. There are some people who need to be in a space with people and computers and desks, and that is completely fine. I think I’m secretly one of those people, but I still enjoy doing some work from my home office.

However, there is a right and wrong way of working from home. Here are some tips that have really helped me over the years.

Don’t work in front of the TV
------

This is so tempting but you will seriously get no work done and then you will feel so ashamed because you watched 3 seasons of friends instead of actually getting work done. Create a space for yourself If you live in a tiny space, this might be a creative challenge, but it is seriously so worth it. I recently bought myself a desk and it has definitely made a difference in my motivation. I look forward to working and I’m not cluttering the kitchen table.

Create a routine
------

This has helped me in both work at home and co-working environments. Creating a routine in the morning or whenever you find yourself waking up will help your day tremendously. I get up, let my dog out, make coffee, eat breakfast, watch an episode of friends, and read in the morning all before going to work. I no longer feel like I’m rushing to work, but I feel ready and caffeinated. Whether it’s doing yoga in the morning or making yourself breakfast, creating a routine for yourself that you stick to will help you feel ready.

Take breaks
------

Don’t abuse this rule, but take breaks at least every 2 hours. Working can get draining, especially when you have no one to vent to, but giving yourself room to go for a quick walk or to do the dishes is worth it.
