title: Why Community College Matters
---
When people think of community college, they think about old, run down classrooms, cranky professors, seeing people from high school you’ve been avoiding, and weird groups of people who sit in the common area saying absurd things to fellow students.

Community College is exactly like this. At my community college there was really old buildings that may or may not have had asbestos, old professors who were counting down the days until retirement, I literally ran into everyone that I had been trying to avoid for the past four years, and there was definitely a group of people who sat outside the library doing/saying weird things (I’m actually convinced that these people didn’t actually attend the school, just wanted to sit outside the library and attempt to look cool).

Even so, community college was one of the best things for me. It is where I discovered my love of writing and research, I met my best friend, I was mentored by amazing professors, and I was challenged academically. So despite all the weird aspects of community college, I still managed to get a great education while also discovering who I am. In fact, I think that community college gave me more freedom to discover what exactly I wanted to do, without the pressure of declaring my major or losing my financial aid/scholarship because I didn’t graduate on time.

So why does community college matter? It matters because it allowed to gain education without breaking the bank. I was able to attend classes while also saving money. I was able to work full time and get my associates degree. Community College was weird and strange, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. Each and every professor truly cared and wanted me to succeed; something that is not easily found.
